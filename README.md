# CSS Signup/Login Page

A simple and aesthetic signup/login page built with HTML and CSS.
(I really wanted a break from JS hell.)

[Tutorial Used](https://youtu.be/hlwlM4a5rxg?si=1YafYmrVAJcxPdC7)
I added my own basis though! Colors, styling, the sign-up page, the animations and transitions, etc!
Kept the background though, 'cause it's sweet.

## Demo
- https://css-signup-login-page.vercel.app/

## Features
- It is very little-ly animated. I spent a lot of time on that.

## Usage
- Click on the buttons and see what they do (next to nothing).

### HAVE FUN!!
